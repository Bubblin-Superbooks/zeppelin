The discovery of aluminum made this problem less difficult, however, and many models were designed with the framework of this light material.</p><p>Two years after Count Zeppelin had completed his first designs and while he was still endeavoring to arouse enough interest to warrant the construction of a rigid ship, an aluminum framework rigid ship was built by another group near Berlin. This ship was of approximately 150 feet in length, but of an essentially different design from Zeppelinâ€™s. The outer cover was made of metal.</p></div> </div>
