To meet these new conditions the airships were continuously compelled to fly higher. They also required speed greater than the average of 54 miles per hour (25 meters per second) because while navigating over the North Sea they frequently encountered winds of from 33.5 to 40 miles per hour (15 to 18 meters per second).</p><p>To meet these conditions the L-30 was built (). It had a gas capacity of 1,942,000 cubic feet (55,000 cubic meters) and was nearly twice as large as the original 1,129,920 cubic feet (32,000 cubic meters) four motored ships. The L-30 was ready in May, 1916. It was almost perfectly streamlined. The long cylindrical hull, so convenient from a production standpoint, had been abandoned. The L-30â€™s stern tapered gracefully to a fine point.</p></div> </div>
