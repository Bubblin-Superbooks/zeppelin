Weather observations were made each morning and telegraphed to all other stations. This enabled all Zeppelin pilots to be thoroughly informed before setting out on a flight. The special data supplied by the Zeppelin stations was more adequate for airship requirements than that from the Government official weather bureau. Wireless equipment was installed late in 1913.</p></div> </div>
