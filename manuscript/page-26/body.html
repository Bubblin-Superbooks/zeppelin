<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="chapter-begin">Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin was born at Constance on Lake Constance (Bodensee), Germany, July 8th, 1838.

His creative faculties demanded something more of life than the routine of inspections, drills and dress parades. </p>

Zeppelin had lived to see <em>more than a hundred rigid airships built </em> from his designs and under his personal supervision.</p></div> </div>
