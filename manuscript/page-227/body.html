<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The first ship to fill the requirements essential to safe and steady commercial operations was the “Schwaben” built in the summer of 1911. She was 459.2 feet (140 meters) long, 45.9 feet (14 meters) in diameter, and of 615,580 cubic feet (18,000 cubic meters) hydrogen gas capacity. Her three Maybach 145 horsepower motors gave the “Schwaben” a speed of 43 miles an hour (19.3 meters per second). She had a useful lift of 8,818.4 pounds (4,000 kilograms). During the latter part of 1911 more than a hundred flights were made with the “Schwaben” between Lake Constance, Niederheim, Gotha, and Berlin. These flights warranted larger ships.</p><p>PLATE 46</p><p>The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Nordstern.” Interior view with gas bags removed.</p></div> </div>
