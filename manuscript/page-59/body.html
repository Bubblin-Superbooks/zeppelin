	<p>Experiments with this craft were immediately successful. Zeppelin guided it over the lake between three and four hours in a single flight, making wide circles and maneuvering under absolute control, remarkable in view of its size. The ship also showed superior speed, making 28.8 miles per hour (13 meters per second).</p>
