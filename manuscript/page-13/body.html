<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>“Of all inventions, the alphabet and the printing press alone excepted, those inventions which abridge distance have done most for civilization.”</p><p>—Macaulay.</p><p>The economic value of the fast transportation of passengers, mail and express matter has been well proven. The existing high speed railway trains and ocean liners are the result of the ever increasing demand for rapid communication both on land and water.</p><p>Saving in time is the great essential. The maximum surface speed has apparently been attained. The railways and steamships of today, while indeed fast, have reached their economical limit of speed and it is not to be expected that they will be able, because of the enormous additional cost of operation involved, to attain much greater speeds.</p></div> </div>
