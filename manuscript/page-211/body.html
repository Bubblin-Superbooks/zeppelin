Agents of the Hamburg-American Line (“HAPAG”) which had offices in all German cities, also represented Zeppelin, and reservations were made on the same basis as for ocean going vessels.</p><p>The “Deutschland” was the first Zeppelin operated by the “DELAG.” The motors, however, were not very dependable; and the low speed of the ship, combined with lack of experience made it susceptible to minor accidents. The Deutschland was so badly damaged, finally, that Zeppelin was compelled to rebuild her. During the period that she was being reconstructed the Zeppelin LZ-6 was substituted.</p></div> </div>
