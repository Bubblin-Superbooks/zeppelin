<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The original shed, built in 1908-09 and first used in 1910, is now the ring building factory, where the great transverse frames for the Zeppelins are made. It is 603½ feet (184 meters) long, 150.8 feet (46 meters) wide and stands 65.6 feet (20 meters) high—huge dimensions in the early days but utterly dwarfed by the great sheds which have since appeared alongside. There are double doors at each end, one set operated on the turning, the other on the sliding principle. They are opened and closed by electricity in a few minutes.</p><p>In this shed twenty-eight Zeppelins were assembled, the last being LZ-39 after which it was devoted to the transverse ring frames.</p></div> </div>
