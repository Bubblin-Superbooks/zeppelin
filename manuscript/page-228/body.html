These Zeppelins were 485.4 feet (148 meters) long and 45.9 feet (14 meters) in diameter. They each held 670,890 cubic feet (19,000 cubic meters) of hydrogen and their useful lift was 11,023 pounds (5,000 kilograms). Motors had been so improved that the “Victoria Louise” and “Hansa” were able to make 44.7 and 46.9 miles per hour respectively.</p></div> </div>
