<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Attracted by Count Zeppelin’s earlier flights, hundreds of persons made reservations for the regularly conducted commercial trips, when in 1910 he organized the Deutsche Luftschiffahrt, A.&nbsp;G. (German Air Ship Transportation Co.), briefly called the “DELAG”. There was apparently a popular demand for commercial airship transport. Zeppelin founded the “DELAG” to meet this demand, and also to provide operating personnel and train pilots and crews for the other services, which he knew, would be necessary in case of emergency.</p><p>The “DELAG” was capitalized for 3,000,000 marks (approximately $714,000) and while it was a subsidiary of Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin, there also participated in this commercial operating organization a number of capitalists, whose faith in commercial air transport was fully justified by the success of the “DELAG” despite much difficulty the first year or so due to lack of meteorological data and inexperience.</p></div> </div>
