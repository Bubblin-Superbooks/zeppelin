<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The real work for which the “DELAG” was created, “to develop commercial air transport” was of necessity put aside during the period of the war, but these activities were resumed early in 1919 when it was decided to start a regular daily passenger service, at first between Berlin and Friedrichshafen, a distance of 373 miles (600 kilometers) and afterward extend it to Switzerland, Italy, Spain in the south and to Sweden in the north. The pre-war personnel of the “DELAG” was assembled at Friedrichshafen and the route to Berlin started by the new Zeppelin “Bodensee” on August 24th, 1919 ().</p></div> </div>
