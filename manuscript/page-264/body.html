Several announcements have been made that either an airplane or airship service was about to be started. The Zeppelin engineers came to the United States not long ago and made a preliminary survey of that route. They based their report on a thorough examination of daily weather maps and reports for the last thirty years and stated that a New York-Chicago route could be operated successfully. It was pointed out that the New York-Chicago line would assume more responsibility for the fair name of commercial airship transport than anywhere on earth, more so, even than the trans-atlantic route which, technically, is far less difficult.</p><p>PLATE 57</p></div> </div>
