Another order was placed, this time for a Zeppelin of much larger dimensions. It was christened the L-2 and delivered in September, 1913 (). This ship represented an utterly new departure in design, later universally adopted. A corridor was built forming a keel on the inside and bottom of the ship (). It had a gas capacity of 953,370 cubic feet (27,000 cubic meters) and was equipped with four motors of 180 horsepower each.</p><p>Being the first of the kind it was inevitable that the corridor arrangement should develop a flaw. It lacked proper ventilation. Hydrogen leaked out from the ship and was drawn into the motor gondolas. On one of its first flights this caused an explosion on the L-2 which sent it to the ground a wreck.</p></div> </div>
