They contributed largely to the success of the commercial Zeppelin before the war. In 1915 a 240 horsepower motor was built, and this was the principal motor used on the military and naval Zeppelins. Maybach produced an entirely new motor in 1917. It supplied from 260 to 320 horsepower and is noted as the first supercompression motor. Quickly recognized as the best engine for airplanes, it became the leading German aviation motor until late in 1918 when other motors built on similar principles appeared and were found more adaptable to the planes. Maybach, meanwhile, developed other types (), principally 160 and 260 horsepower units for heavier-than-air craft.</p></div> </div>
