<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This car was one of the most unique inventions developed during the war. It could be lowered with an observer aboard, fully one kilometer (3,280 feet) below the Zeppelin. Here the observer could get his bearings while his ship lay far above hidden in the clouds. The ship could fly or drift above the clouds to a point directly over the spot to be bombed, then by lowering the car with the observer through and just below the clouds, he was able to direct both the operations of the ship and the bombing. A telephone connection ran up through the supporting cable. He was able to signal for bomb releases and navigate so efficiently that any objective could be attacked without danger of the enemy seeing the Zeppelin lurking behind the clouds.</p></div> </div>
