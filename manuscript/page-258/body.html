<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A sister ship of the “Bodensee” was built during the last quarter of 1919, and named the “Nordstern” but in December, that year, the Inter-Allied Air-Control Commission ordered the airship operations stopped. The “Bodensee” was delivered to Italy and the “Nordstern” to France in 1921.</p><p>Once more the aeronautical world became interested in Zeppelins. The last cruise of the “Bodensee” under German management took her from Friedrichshafen to Rome. She cruised over Zurich, Bern, Geneva and Avignon, often making 160 kilometers an hour, to the Mediterranean, near St. Rafael. Visitors at Cannes, Nice and Monaco saw a rigid airship for the first time as the “Bodensee” held to her route passing directly over Corsica and Elba, and finally to the airdrome in Ciampino, between Rome and the Albanian mountains. She had made more than 825 miles (1,329 kilometers) in 12 hours and 49 minutes, at an average speed of 64.6 miles (104 kilometers) an hour for the entire distance.</p></div> </div>
