Over them all is the General Director, Mr. Alfred Colsman, and Chief Engineer, Dr. Ing. Ludwig DÃ¼rr, the latter having been with Count Zeppelin since the first airship was started and to whom much of the credit must be given for the success attained.</p><p>There are various departments including the planning and supervising divisions, two designing divisions (one for scientific and general design, the other for workship and drawings), the manufacturing and erecting divisions, calculating and accounting, testing and controlling, and general maintenance divisions. The research department is a separate organization.</p></div> </div>
