By continually striving to increase efficiency they secured simplified control systems and ships that handled more easily, hulls that were far more rigid yet lighter than their predecessors. Even the framework was lightened as by degrees it was made stronger. Many structural parts were standardized, facilitating production and repairs.</p></div> </div>
