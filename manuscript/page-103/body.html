In November, 1917, the Zeppelin L-59 () was sent to German East Africa with medicines and ammunition for the beleaguered colonial troops. The Zeppelin was especially prepared for the flight, all superfluous equipment, such as bomb dropping apparatus and armament being removed, all available space reserved for the cargo. The L-59 was longer by 98.5 feet (30 meters) than the others. This made room for two additional gas bags. Inside her 744Â½ foot hull (227 meters) were 2,381,000 cubic feet (68,000 cubic meters) of hydrogen. She could carry 50 tons easily. With only five motors she averaged 62.6 miles per hour (28 meters per second).</p></div> </div>
