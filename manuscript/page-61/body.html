This increased size gave it a carrying capacity of 37,478 pounds (17,000 kilograms) which, with increased motor power—each engine estimated at approximately 100 horsepower—made it a practical weight carrying and speedy craft.

It marked the beginning of refinement in design and conveniences which has been continued unceasingly. Here was an airship which Zeppelin felt worthy of demonstrating to the public at large.</p></div> </div>
