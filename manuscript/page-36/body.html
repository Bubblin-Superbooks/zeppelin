<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify">This ship was of approximately 150 feet in length, but of an essentially different design from Zeppelin’s. The outer cover was made of metal.</p>
<p> On its first trial flight it was compelled to land, due to engine trouble and the fact that the framework of the ship was not strong enough to stand the stresses of the landing, caused it to go to pieces and this failure was quickly seized upon by the then existing adversaries of the rigid airship as an argument against the construction of rigid airships with a metal framework. This was unfortunate to the cause of rigid airships, because while Zeppelin had not been identified with that attempt, all experimenters were included in the popular condemnation.</p>
<p>Zeppelin’s improvements were beginning to be recognized and admitted, but the money necessary for the development was not forthcoming.</p>
