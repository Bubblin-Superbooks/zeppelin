<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As far as practicable, each Zeppelin was assigned to a definite air harbor, which was known as its home station, or terminal. Here all the repairs and maintenance were done. The members of the crew were assigned to suitable homes, all located in that immediate vicinity. The maintenance crews for airships and sheds were also stationed there. These auxiliaries averaged thirty persons under the direction of a foreman. They, too, formed the nucleus for the landing party necessary to handle the airships on arrival or departure. Each air harbor had a manager and his assistants to handle business details.</p><p>PLATE 45</p><p>The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Bodensee.” Crew’s Quarters.</p><p>Water Ballast Bag, Capacity 300 Kilos.</p></div> </div>
