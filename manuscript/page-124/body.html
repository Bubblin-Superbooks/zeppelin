<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There exists in the field of engineering an impartial, positive and unswerving means of determining the relative merits of things; and that is by a technical analysis of their success. By it one may recognize the values of the principles and construction methods involved. It is commonly said that nothing succeeds like success; and this is virtually true of the Zeppelins. Their record for efficiency remains unsurpassed, as a matter of fact, unequalled. It has never been denied that they were superior to contemporary craft or that they failed to maintain an increasing advantage over them.</p><p>This comparison is justified by the following figures which we will first attempt to explain.</p><p>It will be noted that there are three kinds of efficiency, (1) Speed (the aerodynamical figure), (2) Lift (the constructional figure) and (3) All-around efficiency (the combined quality figure).</p></div> </div>
