<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One of the main requisites for success in any industry is the welfare of the men and women employed; and the establishment of the great Zeppelin organization created a community of employees in the small town on Lake Constance which demanded increasing attention as the organization expanded.</p><p>At first questions of industrial and social welfare were settled by a special department within Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin, but in September, 1913, a separate organization (Zeppelin Wohlfahrt G.m.b.H.) was provided. Count Zeppelin specified that homes for the men be provided immediately; that they should be built “economically but that they should make for comfort.” One hundred and one single family houses were completed in July, 1916, and the new community was named Zeppelindorf (Zeppelin village) (). Each house sits in a garden which enables the occupant to raise his own vegetables and fruits.</p></div> </div>
