<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The “DELAG” has been credited with the entire development of airship navigating technique. For one thing, it was the only organization of its kind, training airship personnel in practical operations. The “DELAG” airships and airship crews were used almost exclusively for training purposes when war was declared. At that time there were two other airship construction companies in Germany, Schütte-Lanz and Parseval. Both of these organizations procured their airship pilots from the trained personnel of the “DELAG.”</p><p>PLATE 49</p><p>The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Nordstern.” Rear view of rear power gondola containing two 260 horsepower Maybach motors.</p></div> </div>
