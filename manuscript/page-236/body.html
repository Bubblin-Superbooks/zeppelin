She was the same size as the pre-war Commercial Zeppelins, but had twice the engine power, carried twice their useful load and maintained a speed equal with the former ships using only one-half of their engine power.</p><p>20-30,000 Cubic Meter Fast Passenger Zeppelin “Bodensee” Type.</p><p>The “Bodensee” was 426.4 feet (130 meters) long, after she had been lengthened by 32.8 feet (10 meters).
