The largest shed is 115 feet high, 151 feet wide and 787 feet long.</p><p>Following the ideas of the inventor both the German army and navy used the Zeppelins for strategical reconnoissance in the early days of the conflict. The Zeppelins flew the western and eastern boundaries of the empire seeking information concerning the movements of the Allied armies. This proved dangerous, however, for the airships then could not rise to high altitudes; and consequently were exposed to enemy fire from the batteries below and airplanes above.</p><p>The L-3 operated with the fleet in the North Sea and her activities served to show the value of supplying as quickly as possible Zeppelins able to fly high and with greater speed than ever. It was also found advisable to cease flying over land by day.</p></div> </div>
