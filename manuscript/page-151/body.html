Here the passenger Zeppelin “Sachsen” was lengthened early in 1914. The last of the sixteen ships built there was the army Zeppelin LZ-81 late in 1916, after which, because the shed was too small for the larger ships, it was used for building giant seaplanes. Later on it was converted into a special repair factory of all the airship motors. The airship personnel was transferred to the Staaken plant near Berlin.</p></div> </div>
